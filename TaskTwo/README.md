## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

this program has two classes, product and shoping cart. 
the product class allows us to set the product ID, name, and the cost of the products, and the taxrate and the markup. it also has accessor methods for all of these and a method calle toString that returns the name of the product and its retail price.

the second class, shopping cart, lets us add and remove items from an array list which represents all he items in the shopping cart. we can also check whether an item is in the array. it also has a method which returns the total cart price including tax, a method which returns the cart price without tax, and a method that returns the total price of the cart including tax and clears the cart called checkout. another method returns the number of items in the cart. And a final method to return the names of all the items along with their price on separate lines.
